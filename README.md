# Todo List 

### ToDo list project for the Odin Project. Here, I applied Object Oriented Programming Principles that I learned throughout the lessons leading up to this project. My biggest takeaway from this project was using SOLID principles and building modular components. I also learned about LocalStorage and implemented it into this project.
